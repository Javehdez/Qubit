- zero-copy network IO
- HTTP streamimg
- F#, replacing some Erlang

On Loic’s suggestion to checkout Qubiq/QuickCheck

Ignore this corporate page, its useless.
http://www.quviq.com/index.html

this I saw first in haskell, but its the same people
QuickCheck is worth checking out, and there is FsCheck in the same spirit.

this links explains QuickCheck in haskell way, which may be simpler

Server MVMs

SNMP
- map hardware and network architecture
- expose all monitoring metrics and tools
- discover all MIBs

Async FNode
- make F# handle async requests in pipe form
- create protocol for erlang communication
- make server do transactions

Contention Points Elimination
- relax locking
- tidy up old server code
- death of OTP.Net
- global elimination

Bot Net
- ML-driven bots
- stochastic bots for load testing
- aws and software tooling

Persistance
- riak
- account process sleep and recover

Frontend
- nginx
- firewall hiding of entire erlang mesh
- websockets forwarding
- ssl websockets

Mult-Data Center
- can we live with the ping?
- latency tests
- world-wide transactions

Version
- data version tagging
- data upgrade chain
